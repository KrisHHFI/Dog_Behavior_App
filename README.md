# Dog Behavior App

I’m collaborating with [Jack's Dog Behavior and Training](https://www.instagram.com/jacksdogbehaviourandtraining/) to develop a dog behavior app! Jack envisioned the entire app—planning its functionality, page structure, and UI. While he initially had no coding experience, he’s now actively developing the app, with me mentoring him along the way. Jack brings his expertise in dog behavior, and together, we’re bringing his vision to life.
